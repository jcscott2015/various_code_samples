# timeCounter Directive
This directive displays either the current date and time or becomes a countdown timer when certain attributes are provided in the view. This directive is asynchonous, so it won't bog down the digest cycle.

The spec file works with karma testing. The directive is compiled by the test and then its attributes are tested for expected results.
